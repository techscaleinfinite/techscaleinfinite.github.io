# ⚙️ Yopass Deployment

## Yopass - Secure Secrets Sharing

**Yopass** is a dedicated project for swiftly and securely sharing confidential information. Its primary objective is to reduce the proliferation of passwords in ticket management systems, Slack messages, and emails. Messages are locally encrypted/decrypted in the browser before being sent to Yopass, which never stores the decryption key. Yopass generates a one-time URL with a defined expiry date, ensuring a secure and temporary sharing solution.
