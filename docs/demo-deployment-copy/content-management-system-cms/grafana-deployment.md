### Volume Mounts

| Path Mapping                                  | Description                                            |

| grafana-storage:/var/lib/grafana               | Maps the volume named 'grafana-storage' to the container's '/var/lib/grafana' directory. This allows Grafana to store its data in the specified volume. |

This volume mount ensures that Grafana can store its data persistently in the 'grafana-storage' volume. Adjust the volume name and paths as needed.
