**Apache Tomcat** is an open-source web server and servlet container, serving as both a web server and a Java servlet/JSP container. It facilitates Java-based web application deployment, handling HTTP requests, servlet processing, and JSP execution. With connectors for communication, context isolation for applications, and a web-based administrative interface, Tomcat provides a configurable and secure platform. Its vibrant community and compatibility with Java EE standards make it a preferred choice for hosting dynamic Java web content.
