### &#x20;Steps And Procedure

* &#x20;**Docker image of this application consists of following layers :**

```
'FROM debian:buster' Taking debian:buster as the base image.

And updating and installing all the required softwares like 'openssh-server' 'supervisor' 'net-tools'

Installing the Xampp software. And configuring Xampp to Enable web interface, error display in php.

And creating a /www folder and a symbolic link to it in /opt/lampp/htdocs. This is convenient because it doesn't interfere with xampp, phpmyadmin or other tools in /opt/lampp/htdocs.
