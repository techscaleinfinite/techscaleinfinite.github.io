Varnish, an open-source caching HTTP reverse proxy, enhances web server performance by caching content in memory. It acts as a reverse proxy, caching requested web pages and resources, reducing server load, and speeding up response times. Varnish supports cache invalidation for content updates, load balancing across multiple servers, and HTTP acceleration, optimizing the overall user experience.
